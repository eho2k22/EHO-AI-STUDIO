Write a summary of using oligonucleotides to detect cfDNA in liquid biopsy, Oligonucleotides are short strands of nucleic acid \n
molecules that can be used to detect circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in liquid biopsy. This type of biopsy is a minimally invasive \n
procedure that involves taking a sample of body fluid, such as blood or urine, to detect the presence of disease. Oligonucleotides \n
are used to detect cfDNA because they are able to bind to specific sequences of DNA and amplify them in order to detect the presence \n
of disease. This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of cancer because it can detect small amounts of cfDNA that may be present \n
in a sample. Additionally, oligonucleotides can be used to detect genetic mutations associated with certain types of cancer, allowing for more \n
precise diagnosis and treatment.
